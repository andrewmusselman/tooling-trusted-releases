Please be aware that this code is provided solely for exploration and experimentation by ASF Tooling.

## Purpose

This code is intended to one day help ASF Tooling to test internal ideas for the [Apache Trusted Release](https://github.com/apache/tooling-docs/blob/main/apache-trusted-release/requirements.md) platform. In its early phase it consists only of, essentially, an empty Python [asfquart](https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-asfquart) project.
