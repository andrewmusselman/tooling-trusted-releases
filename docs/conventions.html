<h1>Project conventions</h1>
<p><strong>STATUS: Draft.</strong></p>
<p>This document does not yet reflect the consensus of the ASF Tooling team, and, unlike the rest of this codebase, is provided for internal ASF Tooling discussion only.</p>
<h2>Python code</h2>
<p>Follow <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#constants">PEP 8</a> unless otherwise indicated in this document. Some of the conventions listed below recapitulate or add exceptions to PEP 8 rules.</p>
<p>Obey all project local lints, e.g. the use of <code>ruff</code> and specific <code>ruff</code> rules.</p>
<h3>Prefix private interfaces with a single underscore</h3>
<p>Prefix all private interfaces, e.g. functions, classes, constants, variables, with a single underscore. An interface is private when used exclusively within its containing module and not referenced by external code, templates, or processes.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this rule include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type variables</li>
<li>Enumerations</li>
<li>Methods requiring interface compatibility with their superclass</li>
<li>Nested functions, i.e. functions appearing in other functions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use UPPERCASE for top level constants</h3>
<p>Define top level constants using <code>UPPERCASE</code> letters. Don't forget to apply an underscore prefix to constants which are private to their module.</p>
<p>Do not use uppercase for constants within functions and methods.</p>
<h3>Use the <code>Final</code> type with all constants</h3>
<p>This pattern must be followed for top level constants, and should be followed for function and method level constants too. The longer the function, the more important the use of <code>Final</code>.</p>
<h3>Prefix global variables with <code>global_</code></h3>
<p>Top level variables should be avoided. When their use is necessary, prefix them with <code>global_</code>, using lowercase letters, to ensure clear identification of their scope. Use an underscore prefix too, <code>_global_</code>, when the variable is private.</p>
<h3>Import modules as their least significant name part</h3>
<p>Import modules using their least significant name component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Preferred
import a.b.c as c

# Avoid
import a.b.c
</code></pre>
<p>This convention aligns with Go's package naming practices. Follow <a href="https://go.dev/blog/package-names">Go naming rules</a> for all modules.</p>
<p>This only applies to modules outside of the Python standard library. The standard library module <code>os.path</code>, for example, must always be imported using the form <code>import os.path</code>, and <em>not</em> <code>import os.path as path</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a third party module to be imported would conflict with a Python standard library module, then that third party module must be imported with one extra level.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Preferred
import asyncio.subprocess
import sqlalchemy.ext as ext
import aiofiles.os

# Avoid
import asyncio.subprocess as subprocess
import sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio as asyncio
import aiofiles.os.path as path
</code></pre>
<p>It's possible to use <code>from a.b import c</code> instead of <code>import a.b.c as c</code> when <code>c</code> is a module, but we prefer the latter form because it makes it clear that <code>c</code> must be a module, whereas in the former <code>from a.b import c</code> form, <code>c</code> could be any interface.</p>
<p>TODO: There's a question as to whether we could actually use <code>import aiofiles.os.path as path</code> since we import <code>os.path</code> as <code>os.path</code> and not <code>path</code>.</p>
<p>TODO: Sometimes we're using <code>as</code> for standard library modules. We should decide what to do about this.</p>
<h3>Avoid duplicated module names</h3>
<p>Try to avoid using, for example, <code>baking/apple/pie.py</code> and <code>baking/cherry/pie.py</code> because these will both be imported as <code>pie</code> and one will have to be renamed.</p>
<p>If there are duplicates imported within a single file, they should be disambiguated by the next level up. In the pie example, that would be <code>import baking.apple as apple</code> and then <code>apple.pie</code>, and <code>import baking.cherry as cherry</code> and <code>cherry.pie</code>.</p>
<h3>Never import names directly from modules</h3>
<p>Avoid importing specific names from modules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Preferred
import p.q.r as r
r.s()

# Avoid
from p.q.r import s
s()
</code></pre>
<p>The collections.abc and typing modules are an exception to this rule. Always import collections.abc and typing identifiers directly using the <code>from</code> syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Preferred
from typing import Final

CONSTANT: Final = &quot;CONSTANT&quot;

# Avoid
import typing

CONSTANT: typing.Final = &quot;CONSTANT&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Use concise typing patterns</h3>
<p>Do not use <code>List</code> or <code>Optional</code> etc. from the typing module.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Preferred
def example() -&gt; list[str | None]:
    return [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, None]

# Avoid
from typing import List, Optional

def example() -&gt; List[Optional[str]]:
    return [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, None]
</code></pre>
<h3>Never name interfaces after their module</h3>
<p>Do not name interfaces with the same identifier as their containing module. For example, in a module named <code>example</code>, the function names <code>example</code> and <code>example_function</code> are prohibited.</p>
<h3>Keep modules small and focused</h3>
<p>Maintain modules with a reasonable number of interfaces. Though no strict limits are enforced, modules containing numerous classes, constants, or functions should be considered for logical subdivision. Exceptions may be made when closely related functionality necessitates grouping multiple interfaces within a single module.</p>
<h3>Name functions to group related items together alphabetically</h3>
<p>Modules should, in general, be split into small collections of code items. If this is unavoidable, large groups of functions should be named hierarchically, with the most general category first, followed by increasingly specific details. This makes related functions group together naturally when sorted alphabetically, making code navigation and discovery easier.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<p>Instead of scattered, hard to find related functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Avoid
def get_user_from_db():
def insert_new_record():
def query_user_settings():
def update_db_record():
</code></pre>
<p>Use hierarchical naming that groups related functionality:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Preferred
def db_user_get():
def db_record_insert():
def db_user_settings_query():
def db_record_update():
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if the same prefix is used for a large number of functions, that indicates that these functions are a good candidate for splitting off into their own module.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<p>Another example with license files, the wrong way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Avoid
def check_root_license_file():      # Lost among other &quot;check_&quot; functions
def validate_package_license():     # Separated from other license functions
def verify_license_files():         # Yet another scattered license function
</code></pre>
<p>The right way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Preferred
def license_root_file_check():      # All license-related functions
def license_package_validate():     # will appear together when
def license_files_verify():         # sorted alphabetically
</code></pre>
<p>Note how verbs tend to come last, so that function names now read in an object oriented style, like a module, object, and action.</p>
<p>While this approach can lead to slightly longer function names, the benefits of improved code organisation and discoverability outweigh the verbosity.</p>
<p>Classes should always be placed before functions. Private, underscored, classes should be placed after all public classes, and likewise for functions.</p>
<h3>Give helper functions the same prefix as their parent function</h3>
<p>This makes it easier to find all the functions related to a specific task.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Avoid
def _verify_archive_integrity():
def _do_something_in_verify_archive_integrity():
</code></pre>
<p>Use the same prefix:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Preferred
def _verify_archive_integrity():
def _verify_archive_integrity_do_something():
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easier to find all the functions related to a specific task, and means that they sort together.</p>
<h3>Keep cyclomatic complexity below 10</h3>
<p>We limit function complexity to a score of 10. If the linter complains, your function is doing too much.</p>
<p>Cyclomatic complexity counts the number of independent paths through code: more if/else branches, loops, and exception handlers means higher complexity. Complex code is harder to test, maintain, and understand. The easiest way to fix high complexity is usually to refactor a chunk of related logic into a separate helper function.</p>
<h3>Replace synchronous calls with asynchronous counterparts in async code</h3>
<p>Our use of blockbuster enables automatic detection of synchronous function calls within asynchronous code. When detected, replace these calls with their asynchronous equivalents without performance testing. The conversion process typically requires minimal, trivial effort.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this rule apply only in these scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>When dealing with third party dependencies</li>
<li>When the asynchronous equivalent function is unknown</li>
</ul>
<p>If either exception applies, either submit a brief issue with the blockbuster traceback, notify the team via Slack, or add a code comment if part of another commit. An ATR Tooling engineer will address the issue without requiring significant time investment from you.</p>
<h3>Always use parentheses to group subexpressions in boolean expressions</h3>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a or b and c == d or e
</code></pre>
<p>Do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">(a or b) and (c == d) or e
</code></pre>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<h3>Use sentence case for headings</h3>
<p>We write headings like &quot;This is a heading&quot;, and not &quot;This is a Heading&quot; or &quot;This Is A Heading&quot;. This follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Section_headings">Wikipedia style for headings</a>. The same goes for button texts.</p>
