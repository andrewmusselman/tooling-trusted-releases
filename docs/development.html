<p>Ensure that you have the pre-commit hook installed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">make sync PYTHON=&quot;$(which python3)&quot;
poetry run pre-commit install
</code></pre>
<p>To run the project, use the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">make sync PYTHON=&quot;$(which python3)&quot;
make certs
make serve
